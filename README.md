# Double Jump
Double Jump mod for quake and compatible with the 2021 rerelease
Finally adds the ability to do double jumping in Quake 1 inspired by Mario and other FPS games featuring the mechanic (Halo and titanfall come to mind)  
With good timing a double jump is almost as powerful as a rocket jump.  You can jump between floors on DM1, DM5 and DM7.  Players can also double jump to the quad damage on DM2.

Changes also make the axe and shotgun slightly more powerful to balance the starting loadout.

USE
===
This was developed for PC/windows with a Steam install and so far it has only been developed within this environment.  The batch script copyDat.bat will copy the DAT file contatining the modified game mechanics to the correct folders, namely:
"c:\Users\%USERNAME%\Saved Games\Nightdive Studios\Quake\mpmod"\progs.dat
"c:\Users\%USERNAME%\Saved Games\Nightdive Studios\Quake\Id1"\progs.dat
they can also be copied by hand.

Once this is done wsing the modified gameplay can be achieved for single and multiplayer by launching the re-release, opening the console ('`' key) and entering the command: 'game mpmod' and pressing return.
