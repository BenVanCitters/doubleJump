# Double Jump
Double Jump mod for quake and compatible with the 2021 rerelease
Finally adds the ability to do double jumping in Quake 1 inspired by Mario and other FPS games featuring the mechanic (Halo and titanfall come to mind)  
With good timing a double jump is almost as powerful as a rocket jump.  You can jump between floors on DM1, DM5 and DM7.  Players can also double jump to the quad damage on DM2.

Changes also make the axe and shotgun slightly more powerful to balance the starting loadout.

## USE
This was developed for PC/windows with a Steam install and so far it has only been developed within this environment and I make no gaurantees that it works outside of that.

Copy the `progs.dat` file to
```
"c:\Users\%USERNAME%\Saved Games\Nightdive Studios\Quake\mpmod"\progs.dat
"c:\Users\%USERNAME%\Saved Games\Nightdive Studios\Quake\Id1"\progs.dat
```
Once this is done start the mod for single and multiplayer by launching the re-release, opening the console ('`' key) and entering the command: 'game mpmod' and pressing return.


### BatchScript
The batch script copyDat.bat will copy the DAT file contatining the modified game mechanics to the correct folders, wait two seconds, and then launch the rerelease. This is helpful during development.

### Thanks
This mod was developed using the [FTEQuakeC Dev Suite](https://fte.triptohell.info/downloads)


Big thanks to Dan The Man & JPiolho!
